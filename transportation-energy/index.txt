7:T470,Improving efficiency and sustainability in transportation and energy with engineering biology. While biofuels are one of the most recognizable uses of engineering biology, many other opportunities exist for biotechnology to reduce the impact of the energy and transportation sectors on climate change and to contribute to long-term sustainability. Engineering biology could revolutionize energy storage technologies, turning us away from environmentally-hazardous, and economically unsustainable, rare-earth batteries and enabling a “green” solution to storage of excess electricity from wind and solar. Advancements in microbial fuel cell technology could also enable wide-scale generation of electricity from biological systems. Progress is needed to increase the energy-density of fuel from biological feedstocks and to better capture and utilize organismal electron-transfer. For a different approach at reducing energy use, transportation efficiency could be improved with biomaterials and bio-derived coatings, such as biocoatings for ship hulls to reduce fouling and barnacle build-up, reducing friction and fuel utilization.2:[null,["$","html",null,{"lang":"en","children":[["$","head",null,{"children":[["$","link",null,{"href":"./../tailslim.css","rel":"stylesheet"}],["$","link",null,{"href":"/tailslim.css","rel":"stylesheet"}]]}],["$","body",null,{"children":["$","main",null,{"className":"flex grow min-h-screen justify-center items-start","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-5xl flex flex-col justify-start items-start","children":["$","$L4",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","segmentPath":["children"],"loading":"$undefined","loadingStyles":"$undefined","loadingScripts":"$undefined","hasLoading":false,"error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","errorScripts":"$undefined","template":["$","$L5",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":[["$","title",null,{"children":"404: This page could not be found."}],["$","div",null,{"style":{"fontFamily":"system-ui,\"Segoe UI\",Roboto,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif,\"Apple Color Emoji\",\"Segoe UI Emoji\"","height":"100vh","textAlign":"center","display":"flex","flexDirection":"column","alignItems":"center","justifyContent":"center"},"children":["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","style",null,{"dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"body{color:#000;background:#fff;margin:0}.next-error-h1{border-right:1px solid rgba(0,0,0,.3)}@media (prefers-color-scheme:dark){body{color:#fff;background:#000}.next-error-h1{border-right:1px solid rgba(255,255,255,.3)}}"}}],["$","h1",null,{"className":"next-error-h1","style":{"display":"inline-block","margin":"0 20px 0 0","padding":"0 23px 0 0","fontSize":24,"fontWeight":500,"verticalAlign":"top","lineHeight":"49px"},"children":"404"}],["$","div",null,{"style":{"display":"inline-block"},"children":["$","h2",null,{"style":{"fontSize":14,"fontWeight":400,"lineHeight":"49px","margin":0},"children":"This page could not be found."}]}]]}]}]],"notFoundStyles":[],"childProp":{"current":["$","$L4",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","segmentPath":["children",["theme","transportation-energy","d"],"children"],"loading":"$undefined","loadingStyles":"$undefined","loadingScripts":"$undefined","hasLoading":false,"error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","errorScripts":"$undefined","template":["$","$L5",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":"$undefined","notFoundStyles":"$undefined","childProp":{"current":["$L6",["$","div",null,{"className":"flex flex-col gap-8 w-full h-full grow items-start justify-center","children":[["$","div",null,{"children":"TRANSPORTATION & ENERGY"}],["$","div",null,{"children":"Transportation & Energy addresses engineering biology opportunities in biofuels, electricity production and storage, and reducing emissions from transportation, shipping, and aviation."}],["$","div",null,{"className":"prose","children":["$","p","p-0",{"children":"$7"}]}],["$","$L8",null,{"className":"pt-4","href":"/out","children":"< Home"}]]}],null],"segment":"__PAGE__?{\"theme\":\"transportation-energy\"}"},"styles":null}],"segment":["theme","transportation-energy","d"]},"styles":null}]}]}]}]]}],null]
