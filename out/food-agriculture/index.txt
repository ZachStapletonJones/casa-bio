8:T63a,Agriculture and food systems are especially vulnerable to climate change. More intense and frequent droughts, floods, and heat waves have decimated agricultural output in all parts of the world, but have been especially detrimental to the Global South.1,2,3 The impacts of these extreme climate events are compounded by a growing global population, leading to an acute need to improve food security. On top of this, many current agricultural practices even contribute to climate change and instability, through the production of greenhouse gases (particularly methane), production and over-application of synthetic nitrogen fertilizer, inefficient water use, and production of waste. The food and agriculture sector must leverage engineering biology to both minimize its impact on climate change and to sustain production in the face of abiotic and biotic stressors that result from climate change. The Food & Agriculture theme focuses on engineering biology research opportunities to enable the production of food and crops with lower greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions through climate-friendly biofertilizers, sustainable production of meat and meat-alternatives, crop and soil resilience, opportunities in ‘smart agriculture’, and opportunities to limit food waste or convert it to useful products. Importantly, further advancement of engineering biology for agriculture requires ongoing stakeholder engagement between biotech researchers, legislators, consumers, and agriculture producers in order to identify tolerable risk thresholds, lower barriers to adoption, and incentivize scale-up.3:[null,["$","html",null,{"lang":"en","children":[["$","head",null,{"children":["$","link",null,{"href":"tailslim.css","rel":"stylesheet"}]}],["$","body",null,{"className":"__className_e66fe9","children":["$","main",null,{"className":"flex grow min-h-screen justify-center items-start","children":["$","div",null,{"className":"max-w-5xl flex flex-col justify-start items-start","children":["$","$L5",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","segmentPath":["children"],"loading":"$undefined","loadingStyles":"$undefined","loadingScripts":"$undefined","hasLoading":false,"error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","errorScripts":"$undefined","template":["$","$L6",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":[["$","title",null,{"children":"404: This page could not be found."}],["$","div",null,{"style":{"fontFamily":"system-ui,\"Segoe UI\",Roboto,Helvetica,Arial,sans-serif,\"Apple Color Emoji\",\"Segoe UI Emoji\"","height":"100vh","textAlign":"center","display":"flex","flexDirection":"column","alignItems":"center","justifyContent":"center"},"children":["$","div",null,{"children":[["$","style",null,{"dangerouslySetInnerHTML":{"__html":"body{color:#000;background:#fff;margin:0}.next-error-h1{border-right:1px solid rgba(0,0,0,.3)}@media (prefers-color-scheme:dark){body{color:#fff;background:#000}.next-error-h1{border-right:1px solid rgba(255,255,255,.3)}}"}}],["$","h1",null,{"className":"next-error-h1","style":{"display":"inline-block","margin":"0 20px 0 0","padding":"0 23px 0 0","fontSize":24,"fontWeight":500,"verticalAlign":"top","lineHeight":"49px"},"children":"404"}],["$","div",null,{"style":{"display":"inline-block"},"children":["$","h2",null,{"style":{"fontSize":14,"fontWeight":400,"lineHeight":"49px","margin":0},"children":"This page could not be found."}]}]]}]}]],"notFoundStyles":[],"childProp":{"current":["$","$L5",null,{"parallelRouterKey":"children","segmentPath":["children",["theme","food-agriculture","d"],"children"],"loading":"$undefined","loadingStyles":"$undefined","loadingScripts":"$undefined","hasLoading":false,"error":"$undefined","errorStyles":"$undefined","errorScripts":"$undefined","template":["$","$L6",null,{}],"templateStyles":"$undefined","templateScripts":"$undefined","notFound":"$undefined","notFoundStyles":"$undefined","childProp":{"current":["$L7",["$","div",null,{"className":"flex flex-col gap-8 w-full h-full grow items-start justify-center","children":[["$","div",null,{"children":"FOOD & AGRICULTURE"}],["$","div",null,{"children":"Food & Agriculture addresses specific opportunities for engineering biology to reduce greenhouse gas emissions from food production and waste and towards making agriculture and food systems more robust to climate change."}],["$","div",null,{"children":"$8"}],["$","$L9",null,{"className":"pt-4","href":"/out","children":"< Home"}]]}],null],"segment":"__PAGE__?{\"theme\":\"food-agriculture\"}"},"styles":null}],"segment":["theme","food-agriculture","d"]},"styles":null}]}]}]}]]}],null]
