    title: "Personalized Health and Medicine for Vaccine and Biologics Delivery",
    description: "Biologics are outpacing small molecules as therapeutics and could be an important feature for the future bioeconomy. However, several barriers exist to the greater use of biologics. These include, but are not limited to, the need for a more personalized and tailored approach, limitations in the manufacturing paradigm, prohibitive delivery techniques, and cultural and socioeconomic barriers to their distribution and adoption. A forthcoming workshop will investigate some of these challenges, focusing on the importance and urgency of addressing them to achieve near-term economically beneficial outcomes.",

    title: "Accelerated Breeding for All Economically Important Crops and Animals",
    description: "Fueled by National Agricultural Genome Initiatives, innovative breeding methods are transforming the development of economically important crops and animals, promising significant advances in agricultural productivity and sustainability. However, multiple barriers exist to the widespread implementation of such approaches. These include the need for substantial investment in advanced tools and technologies, gaps in critical infrastructure, regulatory challenges, and concerns about the long-term ecological and genetic impacts, to name a few. A forthcoming workshop will investigate some of these challenges, focusing on the urgent need to find enabling solutions to achieve specific deliverables related to accelerated breeding.",

    title: "Creating Value from Waste Carbon for a Circular Bioeconomy",
    description: "Transforming waste carbon into valuable downstream products is revolutionizing approaches to carbon management, offering significant potential for environmental and economic benefits. However, several barriers exist to the widespread adoption of these innovative strategies. These include, but are not limited to, the need for substantial investment in scalable technologies to close the loop on circularity, problems of integrating new biological methods with existing infrastructure, regulatory and market acceptance hurdles, and technical difficulties in efficiently isolating and converting diverse carbon streams. A forthcoming workshop will investigate some of these challenges, focusing on the importance and urgency of addressing them to achieve specific, near-term deliverables related to advanced carbon transformation.",

    title: "Enabling Resilient Biobased Supply Chains",
    description: "Enabling resilient biobased supply chains for energy, chemicals, materials, and foods has the potential to simultaneously address economic, technical, environmental, and societal challenges, particularly through the development of strategic future-facing product/biomass supply chains. However, several barriers exist to the widespread implementation of new solutions. These include, but are not limited to, the need for substantial investment in: (1) advanced feedstock (raw material) production systems, (2) scale-up and demonstration of logistics and conversion technology integration, (3) gaps in end-market readiness, and (4) the need for robust policy support and societal acceptance. A forthcoming workshop will investigate key challenges, focusing on the importance and urgency of devising solutions to achieve specific, near-term deliverables related to advancing biobased supply chains.",

    title: "Food Protein Diversification",
    description: "Diversifying our food protein sources to feed our growing population offers significant benefits for climate and the environment while building regional economies and jobs within this new sector. While the field has seen significant growth over the last 10 years, there is a need to make a step change in developing regional ecosystems and solutions to unlock the potential of this aspect of the bio-economy. Mindful development of these innovative solutions will help improve regional food security and economic growth while supporting national climate goals, but several barriers exist to their widespread adoption. These include the need for advanced biotechnological research for scalable, cost-effective biomanufacturing processes and infrastructure that utilize regional strengths and resources for a blossoming bio-economy. A forthcoming workshop will investigate some of these challenges, focusing on the importance and urgency of addressing them to achieve specific, near-term deliverables for advancing alternative food protein products and other novel agricultural bioproducts.",

    title: "Strategies to Improve Carbon and Energy Efficiency of Biomanufacturing",
    description: "Biological processes can be used directly to reduce CO2 as well as produce products more efficiently and with less waste. Realizing this vision in a cost-effective way will require strategic research and development to identify the most efficient pathways and strategies. However, several barriers exist to optimizing biological systems and fully leveraging the advantages of biomanufacturing methods over other non-biological approaches. These include, but are not limited to, the need for enhanced carbon and energy efficiency, new innovative technologies, overcoming technical challenges in scaling biomanufacturing processes, and navigating regulatory and market acceptance. A forthcoming workshop will investigate some of these challenges, focusing on the importance and urgency of addressing them to achieve specific, near-term deliverables related to advancing the bioeconomy and optimizing biological systems for carbon reduction.",
