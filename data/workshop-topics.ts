    title: "Protein Diversification for Food, Health, and Environment",
    description: "Diversifying our protein sources to feed our growing population offers significant benefits for climate and the environment while building regional economies and jobs within this new sector. While the field has seen significant growth over the last 10 years, there is a need to make a step change in developing regional ecosystems and solutions to unlock the potential of this aspect of the bio-economy. Mindful development of these innovative solutions will help improve regional food security and economic growth while supporting national climate goals, but several barriers exist to their widespread adoption. These include the need for advanced biotechnological research for scalable, cost-effective biomanufacturing processes and infrastructure that utilize regional strengths and resources for a blossoming bio-economy. A forthcoming workshop will investigate some of these challenges, focusing on the importance and urgency of addressing them to achieve specific, near-term deliverables for advancing alternative protein products and other novel agricultural bioproducts.",

    title: "Strategies to Improve Carbon and Energy Efficiency of Biomanufacturing",
    description: "Biological processes can be used directly to reduce CO2 as well as produce products more efficiently and with less waste. Realizing this vision in a cost-effective way will require strategic research and development to identify the most efficient pathways and strategies. However, several barriers exist to optimizing biological systems and fully leveraging the advantages of biomanufacturing methods over other non-biological approaches. These include, but are not limited to, the need for enhanced carbon and energy efficiency, new innovative technologies, overcoming technical challenges in scaling biomanufacturing processes, and navigating regulatory and market acceptance. A forthcoming workshop will investigate some of these challenges, focusing on the importance and urgency of addressing them to achieve specific, near-term deliverables related to advancing the bioeconomy and optimizing biological systems for carbon reduction.",

    title: "Climate Resilient Agriculture",
    description: "Enhancing our understanding of food and energy/biomass crop production is crucial for developing climate-resilient crop and animal agriculture. By understanding the interactions among animals, crops, their microbiomes, and changing natural and engineered environments, we can significantly improve agricultural sustainability and productivity. However, several barriers hinder advances in this area.  These include, but are not limited to, the need for comprehensive ecological and microbiome research, investment in adaptive agricultural technologies, lack of a technically proficient workforce, and overcoming regulatory and market challenges. A forthcoming workshop will investigate some of these challenges, focusing on the importance and urgency of addressing them to achieve specific, near-term deliverables related to climate-resilient agriculture.",
